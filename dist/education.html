                <h3>Bank of Thailand</h3>
                <h4>Data Analyst Intern</h4>
                <p>
                    While I was working there, I participated in the Telecommunication export value forecasting project. Telecommunication products play a huge role in stabilizing Thailand's economy, with it's value ranked between the top 10 sectors with highest export in the country.
                    My task was to predict the export value of this sector using two forecasting methods, Time-Series forecasting and Machine Learning algorithms using the import value of relevant parts used to produce the items in the sector. Then all results were compared.

                <h3>Chulalongkorn Alumni Mentorship Program (ChAMP)</h3>
                <h4>Organising Committee (OC)</h4>
                <p>
                    ChAMP is the project created to connect the current engineering students to the alumni, ranging from those who were recently graduated to CEOs, Presidents, etc.
                    I am working as an OC. My job is to plan and schedule events, recruit staffs, track mentees (participators), and cooperated with mentors.

                <h3>FECamp</h3>
                <h4>Academic Director</h4>
                <p>The Fundamental Engineering Camp (FECamp) is a project by a group of engineering students aiming to teach high-school students who want to
                    apply to the engineering path in the bachelor's level. I was working in the academic squad, being a head of the team. My job is to train the new generation of teachers
                    (university students, should I say?) about techniques, knowledges, and core values of the camp. I also planned the working schedule, set the objective, and taught high-school students.
